[PyViz](https://pyviz.org/) recently release the first official release (0.60) of [Panel](https://panel.pyviz.org/). Overall, I'm digging the iterative development model of developing dashboard components within Juypter lab/notebook.

Here's an example notebook that will demonstrate creating a few dashboard components in Panel. The raw notebook can be launched using [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gist/mpkocher/83ac8f99a7b6a4ed87f1f2014ef74c2b/master?filepath=panel-dashboard.ipynb))
