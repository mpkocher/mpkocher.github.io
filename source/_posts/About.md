I studied Chemistry and Physics as an undergrad and got my Ph.D. in Material Science specializing in the Electronic Structure of Lithium Transition Metal Oxides for lithium ion batteries. Following graduation, I did a post-doc at [Lawrenece Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/) and was a core member of the original [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/) team from 2009-2012. In April of 2012, I joined [Pacific Biosciences](https://www.pacb.com/) to work in the Secondary Analysis Team in the R&D division. In late October of 2018, I decided to take some time off to travel and work on a few side projects. 


A few languages, libs and tools I Enjoy: Scala, Akka, Python, R, Postgres, Javascript/Typescript, React. 

A few open source projects that I have contributed to. Several Most of these libs/tools are currently used in production code.
