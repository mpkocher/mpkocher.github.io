This is a "now page" which itemizes professional, personal work and other priorities that I'm concentrating on right now.

# What I'm currently Working On

- Leveraging {% link "Scala programming language" "https://www.scala-lang.org/" %} to build robust and maintainable code
- {% link "Ammonite" "http://ammonite.io/" %} for scripting and REPL-ish driven development in Scala
- Dashboard tooling using {% link "Panel" "https://mpkocher.github.io/2019/06/21/Python-Dashboards-With-Panel-Kicking-the-Tires/" %} 
- Deeper dive into Advanced design patterns in {% link "Akka" "https://akka.io" %}
- Exploring different workflow technologies (e.g., {% link "apache-airflow" "https://airflow.apache.org" %}, {% link "prefect" "https://docs.prefect.io" %}) for scientific computing and data analysis
- R for data exploration and visualization utilizing the most excellent [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)
- Exploring [Python PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)s >= 3.8 to better understand the direction and future iterations of the Python Programming Language
