# What I'm currently Working On

- Shipping the next release of {% link "SMRT Link" "http://www.pacb.com/videos/tutorial-smrt-link-overview/" %}
- Leveraging {% link "scala programming language" "https://www.scala-lang.org/" %} to build robust and maintainable code
- {% link "Ammonite" "http://ammonite.io/" %} for scripting
- R for data exploration
- HPC and workflow technologies for scientific computing
- Exploring {% link "Elm" "http://elm-lang.org/" %} for building UI applications

This is a "now page" which itemizes professional, personal work and other priorities that I'm concentrating on right now. It's built in the style pioneered by {% link "Derek Sivers" "https://sivers.org/now" %}
